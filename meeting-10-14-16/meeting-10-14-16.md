Installing Python
=================

* NumPy: Base n-dimensional array package
* SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing
* Matplotlib: Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting
* Sympy: Symbolic mathematics
* Pandas: Data structures and analysis
* Scikit-learn: Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms

The easiest way to get all of these is simply to install the Anaconda installation of Python. This is particularly convenient for Windows users. Download [Anaconda from here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). I strongly recommend you use Python 3.x, and not Python 2.x.

If you want, you can also install all the libraries manually with following command:

    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy pandas scikit-learn
    


Clustering in Python
====================

There is example source code in [cluster.py](cluster.py)

Sample Dataset
==============

There is an example dataset in [vt-cs-grades.csv](vt-cs-grades.csv)
